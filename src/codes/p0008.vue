			Code <strong>P0008</strong> indicates that there is a misalignment between the camshaft and crankshaft, specifically on bank one of the engine. This misalignment can prevent the engine from operating at its peak efficiency and can affect engine timing, leading to potential misfires, rough idling, or stalling.
		</p>
		<p>
			The camshaft and crankshaft are essential parts of your engine, converting reciprocating and rotational motion, respectively. When they are misaligned, the engine cannot synchronize its timing, leading to issues with performance and fuel efficiency.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			P0008 is commonly seen in vehicles from General Motors brands like Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Suzuki, although it can occur in other makes as well. If you encounter this code, itâ€™s important to have a mechanic check the timing components, including the timing belt, chain, and related sensors, to ensure proper alignment and function.
