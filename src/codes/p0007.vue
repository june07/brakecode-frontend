			Code <strong>P0007</strong> signals that the Fuel Shutoff Valve A Control Circuit is experiencing a voltage that is too high. This typically means the PCM has detected an abnormal increase in electrical signal from the shutoff valveâ€™s control circuit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Possible causes include a short to voltage, faulty wiring, a stuck valve, or a malfunctioning PCM. This can lead to excess fuel being delivered or engine performance issues such as rough idle or hard starts.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Check the wiring and connectors for shorts or damage, and test the valve's resistance against manufacturer specs. When in doubt, a qualified technician can run diagnostics to isolate and address the issue effectively.
