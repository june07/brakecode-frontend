		<p class="mb-4">The P0420 code signals a low catalyst system efficiency. This code suggests that the oxygen levels are below the desired threshold (Bank 1), which most often results from problems with your car’s exhaust or fuel systems. It can sometimes be tricky to diagnose.</p>
		<p>The catalytic converter is a component of the vehicle’s exhaust system. It works by oxidizing the remaining unburned fuel and carbon monoxide (CO) from the combustion process into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). It also reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) into nitrogen.</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The converter uses two oxygen sensors – one on the upstream and the other on the downstream. If these sensors show similar readings, something’s wrong. That’s when the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) triggers the P0420 code, causing the check engine light to come on, alerting you that you have a catalyst
			problem.
