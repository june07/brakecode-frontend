			Code <strong>P000D</strong> indicates a slow response from the camshaft position sensor on bank two of the engine, specifically referring to the B camshaft. This means that the sensor or actuator is not responding as expected to the signals from the engine control unit (ECU), which could be caused by mechanical or electrical issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to the P000C code, this issue affects the camshaft’s ability to properly time the engine's intake and exhaust valves. A slow response may result in poor engine performance, such as misfires, stalling, or rough idling.
		</p>

			If you encounter this code, it’s essential to inspect components like the camshaft position sensor, the VVT actuator, or related wiring. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can prevent further engine damage and improve vehicle performance.
