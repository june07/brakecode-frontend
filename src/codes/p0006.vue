			Code <strong>P0006</strong> indicates a problem with the Fuel Shutoff Valve A Control Circuit being too low. This means the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected voltage lower than expected in the circuit controlling the shutoff valve.
		</p>
		<p>
			A low signal could be due to faulty wiring, a damaged shutoff valve, or issues with the PCM itself. The valve is critical for managing fuel delivery, and its failure can result in poor engine performance or no-start conditions.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Inspect connectors and wiring for damage or corrosion, and test the valve for resistance and signal. If unsure, a mechanic should diagnose and confirm the root cause to avoid unnecessary part replacements.
