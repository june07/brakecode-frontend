			Code <strong>P000C</strong> refers to a slow response from the camshaft position sensor on bank two of the engine. This indicates that the camshaft is not responding quickly enough to the signals sent by the engine control unit (ECU), which may be a result of mechanical issues or sensor malfunctions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The camshaft plays a critical role in timing the opening and closing of the engine's valves. If the camshaft position sensor is not functioning properly, it can lead to poor engine performance, including misfires, reduced fuel efficiency, and rough idling.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The P000C code is often associated with vehicles that have variable valve timing (VVT) systems. Itâ€™s advisable to check for issues with the VVT actuator, camshaft position sensor, or any related components if this code appears.
