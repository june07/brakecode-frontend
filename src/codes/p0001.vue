		<p class="mb-4">Your engine’s saying “⛽️ I’m confused!” This code usually appears when the PCM can't properly communicate with the fuel volume regulator. Think of it as trying to open a valve with no power — it's just not happening.</p>
		<p class="mb-4">Inside modern engines, solenoids control the fuel flow like a maestro leading an orchestra. When something goes “open,” it’s like the conductor dropped the baton 🎶❌.</p>
		<p class="mb-4">This code often appears alongside friends like P0002–P0004, each representing different hiccups in fuel pressure communication.</p>
		<p class="mb-4">👨‍🔧 Recommended: Check the wiring harness, connectors, and PCM. Sometimes, just a loose plug is the villain here. Other times, it’s time to call in the pros.</p>
